# CAD

The cad folder contains

- stl of pcb
- f3d files of pcb
- zip files exports from EasyEDA

The stl and f3d files were converted from EasyEDA and are only inteded to be used as rough guide for desiging cases. 

The STL's had to be converted multiple times and should not be trusted as accurate. (PCB-full is off by 1.5%). Hole placements are not guaranteed to be accurate on either model. 

Use PCB-simple since it is the more accurate of the 2 stl files.
